title: Assessing Oly gonad transcriptome assembly 
---

The Trinity assembly is complete. Today I inspected it using `transrate`, in addition to running blast over the weekend to annotate genes using the Uniprot/Swissprot database. Transcriptome assembly quality, as per `transrate` using the trimmed/normalized reads, seem sub-par, as percent good mapping is only 10% ... but I'll investigate further. Check out my Jupyter notebook for more details: [transcriptome-assess-annotate.ipynb](https://github.com/fish546-2018/laura-quantseq/blob/master/notebooks/transcriptome-assess-annotate.ipynb)
