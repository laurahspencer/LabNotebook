title: MACAU Run 1 
---  

I ran MACAU to assess the influence of Oly shell length on methylation counts, given relatedness.  I used wet weight as a covariate.  Check out this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/sr320/paper-oly-mbdbs-gen/blob/master/code/05-MACAU.ipynb) for details.  

[Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sr320/paper-oly-mbdbs-gen/master/analyses/macau/output/20190812-macau.assoc.txt),  which are located in the https://github.com/sr320/paper-oly-mbdbs-gen repo, in the[analyses/macau/ subdirectory](https://github.com/sr320/paper-oly-mbdbs-gen/tree/master/analyses/macau), is a table with many columns. Thus far I have pulled the p-vlaues out to visualize a quick heatmap.  I did this in the [04-raw-count-files.Rmd notebook](https://github.com/sr320/paper-oly-mbdbs-gen/blob/master/code/04-raw-count-files.Rmd) (probably will move that elsewhere).  

The heat map was generated by filtering the raw methylated count data with only loci that MACAU identified as DMLs, witht he very conservative p-value of 0.001. The samples mostly cluster by population, with the exception of samples 12 ans 18 - those are two South Sound samples (#10-18) that cluster with Hood Canal samples (#1-9).
