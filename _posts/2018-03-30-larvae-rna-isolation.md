title: Oly larvae RNA isolation 
---

On 3/30/2018 I isolated total RNA from frozen larval samples. The larval samples were from my 2017 Oly OA study. 

I used the RNAzol's protocol for total RNA, [RNAzol Total RNA Protocol](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/MRC_RNAzol-RT-march-2017.pdf); no issues encountered in the extraction process, however several resulted in very little RNA so I'm glad I did extra samples: 


Selected   for Sequencing | RNA Sample # | Sample # | pH | Gonad Sex | Gonad Stage | Tissue Type | Tissue Sample   date |   | RNA Extraction   Date | RNA   Concentration (ng/ul) | Approximate RNA isolated | Notes

I also encountered black precipitate (see images below). Sam has encountered this before, and it didn't seem to be a problem, check out [his notebook post about it](http://onsnetwork.org/kubu4/2012/01/12/rna-isolation-c-gigas-larvae-from-20110412-20110705/)

I sent some of these (marked with an X under "selected for sequencing") and some of the gonad samples extracted on [March 27th](https://laurahspencer.github.io/LabNotebook/RNA-isolation/) off to Katherine for library prep and sequencing at the U-Chicago facility.
