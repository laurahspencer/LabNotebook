### Histology tissue processing protocol from Mai Saowaros

The following protocol is a compilation of the wisdom from Mai Saowaros, postdoc at the University of the Sunshine Coast, whch I used to prepare oyster gonad tissue slides on Ostrea angasi summer 2018.  

#### Fixation 

Fix tissue in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde, pre-chilled at 4C with gentle shaking.
Fixation time depends on tissue size. For 3-5 mm thick sections, fix overnight. Fixing tissues in the fixative for too long will make the tissues rigid and hence difficult to section, as well as cause a high background staining for IHC work. For thicker sections, longer fixation time is required. Ensure that the ratio of fixative to tissue is high (mimimum 10-20x by volume), particularly if shaking at 4C is not possible. 

After paraformaldehyde fixation, wash tissues in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 3 times, 20 minutes each at 4C with gentle shaking. This removes excessive fixative from the tissues. 

Dehydrate the tissues with 70% Ethanol by washing for 20-30 min 3 times, then store the tissues in fresh 70%EtOH for 1-2 days at room temperature or up to 1 week in the fridge for optimal results.  If longer, refresh with new 70%EtOH every two weeks. It's also okay to hold samples in 70% EtOH at room temperature (20-27 C) for short period of time (e.g. if transferring between locations). 

Processing the tissues quickly is essential for immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and ISH. If, for example H&E staining is being used to determine gonad stage and sex, several weeks of storage should not be a problem (e.g. 8 weeks in my case). 

Reagents used: 
  - 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline at pH 7.4 for washes  
  - 4% Paraformaldehyde (see recipe below)  
  - 3X Phosphate buffered saline  
  - NaOH pellets (can be purchased from hardware store)  
  - 
 
Preparation of 4% Paraformaldehyde Fixative (adapted from [Aguirre lab preparation protocol](http://condor.depaul.edu/waguirre/paraformaldehyde_fixative.doc), which was from Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 5th edition (2002) and Mai's suggestions.

0. IMPORTANT: Use a fume hood when working with PFA, especially powder form 
1. Fill volume of DI or distilled water (I used distilled) equal to slightly less than 2/3 of the final desired volume (in my case, I used 650mL)  
2. Weigh out a quantity of paraformaldehyde equal to 4% volume of the final solution. For example, for 100 ml final volume, weigh 4 g of paraformaldehyde (I prepared 1L 4%PFA, so used 40g PFA powder).   
3. Add paraformaldehyde to water and stir using a magnetic stirrer. It will not yet dissolve. 
4. Add NaOH pellets, a small amount at a time, into the solution and stir until pellets are fully dissolved. Add NaOH until PFA is also dissolved and solution is clear. 
5. Add 1/3 volume of 3X PBS and mix. 
6. The pH of the solution is now as high as >12. Adjust the pH down to 7.4 by using concentrated HCl solution, one drop at a time. Be careful, as pH will drop quickly with small amounts of HCl. 
7. Chill at 4C before using as fixative. 
4% PFA is best prepared fresh for every use  

10X PBS recipe, can be used to make 3X PBS for 4% paraformaldehyde 

To make 10X PBS, mix the following and store indefinitely at room temperature:
-80g NaCl (1.37 M) 
-2g KCl (27 mM)
-11.5g Na2HPO4 7H2O (43 mM)
-2g KH2PO4 (14 mM)
-H2O to 1 Liter

##### Processing 

Process tissues with serial rinses of saline solution [TBD], xylene, and wax.
