title:  Survival data from Olympia oyster feeding/temp trial 
---

Remember when I ran the Olympia oyster broodstock overwintering project, in which I held oysters in 2 temperatures (7, 10) and feeding regimes (low, high) for 3 months? No? check out these notebook entries: [Experimental design post](https://laurahspencer.github.io/LabNotebook/Oly-temp-update/), and [Broodstock fecundity post](https://laurahspencer.github.io/LabNotebook/Month-of-Larvae/)

Larval survival data are in- I grew 12 "families" per treatment separately in mini culture tanks (~800mL), each family had 3 replicates, a total of 144 silos.  I stocked ~800 larvae per tank (according to my error checking I likely stocked 824+/-54 larvae, a ~3% error).  I collected larvae from March 31st - April 19th. At day 50 for each collection group I counted the number of live post-set. I did save all these oysters in their respective groups, so depending on survival over the summer without being tended I have up to 48 separate families of olympia oysters - seems like someone should do something with them.

The following are a series of % survival plots, color coded by treatment.  They show the data in two ways-  simply by treatment, then by treatment over time.  I noticed that some of the larval groups that were released later in the experiment had higher survival.

### Standard boxplot

### Jitterplot of the same data, for a better look at the data spread

### Another boxplot, this time the larvae from overwintering treatment replicates are separated.

### % Survival color coded by treatment, but the x-axis is date I collected the larvae

### Same data as previous plot, but coded differently
