---

### QuantSeq: 
- By August 20th, finish prepping RNA samples for QuantSeq library prep. This includes:
  - Re-running qPCR on a subset of samples with the Actin primer set that detects gDNA. 
  - Quantifying remaining RNA with Qubit  
  - Concentrate dilute samples. Goal is 500 ng in 5 uL.  
  - Assess RNA quality via Bioanalyzer on subset of samples.  
- Week of August 19th: 
  - Get all materials ready for QuantSeq library prep.  
  - Test protocol on 8 samples ("extra" samples).  
- Week of Aug. 26th, if all materials are in lab: begin library prep! 

### Degree: 
- Identify and reach out to potential new committee members  
- Read Jackie's stack of papers, take notes and organize using Evernote  
- Get study lists from Rick & Steven  

### Manuscripts:  
- Finish simplifying O. lurida temperature/food methods, results and discussion.  Get feedback from Steven.  
- Begin revising, or at least organize thoguhts on, Polydora MS as per discussion with Chelsea & Julieta.   

### PCSGA: 
- Review presentation from Aquaculture 2019 for PCSGA.  
- Measure larvae from 2017 OA/T study, possibly include in PCSGA presentation? Maybe Kaitlyn can help with this. Maybe use Jackie's fancy computer.
