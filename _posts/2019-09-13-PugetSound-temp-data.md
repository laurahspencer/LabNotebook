title: Temperature data from Clam Bay, Mud Bay, Fidalgo Bay  
--- 

Over the past 2 years I have accumulated temperature data from a few locations in Puget Sound, WA. Using HOBO data loggers, I collectet temperature (& some light intensity data) from Clam Bay, which is where the Manchester research station is located, from Mud Bay, which is near Bremerton and has a very productive Olympia oyster bed, and from Fidalgo Bay, which is near Anacortes and the location of an assemblage of Olys that are uniquely large. 

The following screenshots from the HOBOware plots are saved in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/laurahspencer/O.lurida_Temperature/tree/master/images), and HOBO/.csv files. 

### Clam Bay Data, various dates Aug. 2017 - Sept. 2019
Data Files: [Clam-Bay-Temperatures](https://github.com/laurahspencer/O.lurida_Temperature/tree/master/data/Clam-Bay-Temperatures)  

Loggers held alongside Olympia oysters hanging off dock ~1-3 meters below surface ("dock"), and inside a tumble bag attached to the racks installed on the beach (accessible below -1').  Clam bay is located at the [NOAA Manchester Research Station](https://goo.gl/maps/XRxCfpsuMeeXqk4DA)
