## Live Olympia oysters  

Checked on leftover Olys from my 2017 and 2018 Manchester experiments yesterday (6/16/19) which were housed at Manchester on the beach and dock.  

### Beach Status

In June 2018 I put mini silos with Oly set - 1 from each "family" - into 3 big oyster bags, and Stuart put them onto the beach in Clam Bay, where they stayed for 12 months. I had cut the silo screen out, so there was plenty of waterflow.  Yesterday I walked out at low tide and collected the bags.  They were shockingly clean - just some kelp growing on the top side of the bag. I only found a few barnacles set on silos. Very few Olys survived: 

[hold for data table] 

In one of the bags I had placed a HOBO pendant data logger. Here's a snapshot of the temperature (black) and light intensity (blue) data:

### Dock Status 

I have 3 cages of Olys hanging from the dock, which contain 

a) Remnant F1 Olys from Jake Heare, which I used in my OA/T experiment and exposed to varying temp and pCO2 levels (probably includes soem of of Katherine's Oyster Bay F2's, too). 

b) Offspring from my Oly OA/T 2017-2018 experiment, bagged into window screen pouches.  Not sure how many I have of each group, but there were tons of live oysters. 

c) Offspring from my Oly temperature/food 2018 experiment. They were bagged into 450um mesh silos, and had now grown much at all.  They were alive, though!

## Planning for final QuantSeq run 

[Sample inventory is located here](https://github.com/laurahspencer/O.lurida_Stress/blob/master/Data/RNA-DNA-Isolation/Sample-inventory-June2019.xlsx)

Need to identify how many samples I have for the large QuantSeq run.  I want to do juveniles that were deployed in Port Gamble Bay, Puget Sound. Here's the inventory:
