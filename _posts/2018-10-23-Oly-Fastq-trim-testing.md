title: O. lurida fastq trim testing 
---

Today I downloaded RNASeq data - four fastq files - from Olympia oyster pooled gonad. The gonad was from Fidalgo Bay and Oyster Bay oysters following a 2017 low pH exposure. I unzipped the files, then tested a couple methods of trimming and plotting quality scores for trimmed/untrimmed files. 

Jupyter notebook to download/trim files:  [Inspecting fastq files.ipynb](https://github.com/fish546-2018/laura-quantseq/blob/master/notebooks/Inspecting%20fastq%20files.ipynb)
