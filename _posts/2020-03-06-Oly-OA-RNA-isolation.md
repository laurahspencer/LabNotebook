title: Oly OA RNA isolation - juvenile ctenidia 
--- 

I'm done with my adult ctenidia & larvae libraries, and have enough kit leftover for ~17 more samples.  I've decided to prep a few of my juvenile samples, which were collected at the end of the summer deployment. It could be very interesting to assess differences in juveniles and whether they are similar to those observed in the parents that were directly exposed. 

I'm doing the **whole body samples** collected from the Hood Canal and Fidalgo Bay populations after they were deployed in Port Gamble Bay.  The Port Gamble Bay deployment site is interesting because survival was much higher there in juveniles from parents exposed to high pCO2, AND environmental pH was lowest at that site during deployment.  I have n=4 per population and parental pH treatment (high or ambient).  I had wanted to do ctenidia tissues, but then I checked out the frozen samples and noticed that they definitely are not just gill - lots of mantle tissue in there too. Therefore, I decided to do whole-body samples to try to standardize the tissue type.  

#### Step 1: Homogenize tissue (March 6th, 2020)  

Need: LN, dry ice, bleach, DI water, mortar + pestle, metal spatulas  

- Added 1mL RNAzol to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.  
- Cleaned mortars, pestles, and metal spatulas. Did this by cleaning under hot water, soaking in 10% bleach/DI solution for a minimum of 10 minutes, rinsing thoroughly with DI water, then rinsing with 190 proof ethanol and letting dry.  
- Put tubes with RNAzol on scale. Ground tissues to powder, scraped with metal spatula and carefully transferred powder to tube. Added approximately 50 mg.  
- I did 8 samples at a time (the # of mortar+pestle kits I have), then cleaned and repeated with another 8.   

#### Step 2: RNA isolation (March 7th, 2020)    

Need: RNAzol, DEPC-treated water, isopropanol, 200-proof ethanol, 1.7 mL tubes 

Followed the [RNAzol® RT RNA Isolation Reagent](https://www.genecopoeia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RNAzol_RT_RNA_Isolation_Reagent_User_Manual.pdf) protocol for Total RNA isolation, using half of my homogenate, so 500 uL. 

RNAzol Steps: 
  - Labeled 1.7 mL tubes with sample numbers, 2 tubes per sample  
  - Added 200 uL DEPC-treated water to one set of tubes  
  - Transferred 500 uL of homogenate to tubes with water, returned rest of homogenate (500 uL) to -20 freezer.  
  - Vortexed homogenate + water vigorously 15 seconds 
  - Held mixture for 15 minutes at room temperature  
  - Centrifuged at 8,000 g (aka rcf) for 15 minutes. 
  - Transfered supernatant to new tubes (used 2nd set of labeled tubes). DNA/proteins/polysaccharides remain in the bottom of the tubes. I added these to a box of ctenidia samples in the -20 freezer.  
  - Added 0.75 mL isopropanol to precipitate RNA  
  - Vortexed vigorously for 15 seconds.  Held for 10 minutes at room temperature  
  - Centrifuged at 8,000 rcf for 10 minutes 
  - Discarded supernatant. A large white RNA pellet was visible in samples (which is good) 
  - Added 500 uL 75% ethanol, which I prepared using the 190 proof ethanol and DEPC-treated water. 
  - Vortexed, made sure the pellet was in the ethanol, then centrifuged at 8,000 rcf for 3 minutes. 
  - Discarded ethanol supernatant, repeated previous step, then discarded ethanol again. 
  - Added 150 uL DEPC-treated water, vortexted at medium speed for ~5 minutes. 
  
### Step 3: DNAse  (March 7th, 2020)  

Using the [Zymo Research RNA Clean & Concentrator™-5](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/rna-clean-concentrator-kits-rcc/products/rna-clean-concentrator-5) I DNAsed my RNA, following their protocol:  

  1. Add 2 volumes RNA Binding Buffer to each sample1 and mix (300 uL)   
  2. Add an equal volume of ethanol (95-100%) and mix (450 uL)  
  3. Transfer the sample to the Zymo-Spin™ IC Column in a Collection Tube and centrifuge for 30 seconds. Discard the flow-through.  
  -- NOTE: at this point I tried to collect all liquid at the bottom of the tubes by quick centrifugation, but some of the RNA precipitated. I tried re-dissolving by vortexing, but it didn't work. I therefore mixed as well I could, then let the precipitate settle, transferred the liquid to the column, then added 25 uL of DEPC-treated water, vortexed to dissolve, then transferred to the column and mixed using the pipette.  

(II) In-column DNAse treatment   
   -- For each sample to be treated, prepare DNase I reaction mix in an RNase-free tube (not provided). Mix well by gentle inversion:  
  - DNase I 5 µl  
  - DNA Digestion Buffer 35 µl  
  -- Prewash the column with 400 µl RNA Wash Buffer. Centrifuge for 30 seconds. Discard the flow through.  
  -- Add 40 µl reaction mix directly to the column matrix. Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes. Then continue with RNA purification (page 3, step 4).  

  4. Add 400 µl RNA Prep Buffer to the column and centrifuge for 30 seconds. Discard the flow-through.  
  5. Add 700 µl RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge for 30 seconds. Discard the flow-through.   
  6. Add 400 µl RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge for 2 minutes to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer. Transfer the column carefully into an RNasefree tube (not provided).  
  7. Add 100 µl DNase/RNase-Free Water directly to the column matrix and centrifuge for 30 seconds.  

### Step 3: Qubit Quantificadtion (March 7th, 2020)   

After isolating and DNAsing my RNA, I quantified using the Qubit, and the Agilent High Sensitivity RNA kit. Most samples' concentration were too high to quantify, so before I assess RNA quality I will add some more water and re-quantify. Here are the samples I processed:
