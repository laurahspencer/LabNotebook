title: March goals
---

Laying down my monthly goals midway through March and towards the end of the quarter means that I need to be realistic/conservative.

Accomplished February/early March: 
  - Re-worked Oly parental OA exposure paper methods/results/discussion   
  - Sent Polydora paper to co-authors for final comments   
  - TA duties maintained  
  - Secured TA-ship for next quarter (shellfish biology with Jackie)  
  - Prepared presentations on Oly OA parental effects  
  - Presented twice at Aquaculture 2019 in New Orleans, the triennial NSA meeting. Presented Oly parental exposure & QuantSeq data in the Mollusc restoration session, and also in the Student Spotlight competition.  
  - Fulfilled my Student Recruit Co-chair duties at the NSA meeting!  
  - Identified how to use remaining grant money - will broaden my larval QuantSeq data, and perhaps do some samples from the 2018 winter temp/food experiment to look at gene expression in high/low performing larval families.  
  - Also decided to keep an eye open for opportunities to sequence adult somatic tissues after Oly OA exposure. 
  
To do, rest of March: 
  - Outline of bypass proposal - start drafting during spring break downtime  
  - Refine discussion section of Oly 2017 paper, outline introduction  
  - NSA quarterly newsletter for Leroy  
  - Start testing QuantSeq analysis pipeline with Oly genome, Salmon (removing the multiple read/transcript auto-correct), Trinity's isogroup designation file.  
  - Plan QuantSeq sample selection, RNA isolation, library prep, sequencing, etc.  
  - Help/facilitate Alanna with RNA extractions  
  - SO MUCH GRADING!!!!  
  - Clean up teaching lab  
  - Revise/finalize cover letter for Polydora paper
