title: June 2019 goals 
--- 


## Accomplished last month: 

### O. lurida 2017-2018 project (OA/Temp carryover)
- Revised MS based on co-author feedback and for general improvements 
- Sent for 2nd round of comments. 

### O. lurida 2018 project (Temp/Food carryover)
- Finished 1st draft discussion
- Correlated CV for larval shell length/width with # larvae released that day (is CV higher with more larvae?) Answer: no.

### Bypass & admin:
- Compiled draft application, including draft dissertation 
- Scheduled committee meeting 

### NSF GRFP
- Met with Krista N. re: NSF GRIP, interesting Dungeness crab project looking at larval epigenomes in various pCO2  
- Submitted NSF GRFP funding request for next year (final year)

### Oly methylation data:
- Pulled matrices for Katherine

### Oly QuantSeq data & future steps: 
- Expanded plan of attack. Would like to include some juvenile Port Gamble whole-body samples to compare those with high pCO2 parental histories vs. no history, in the location where parental history correlated with survival


## Goals / To Do List 

### Admin
- Prepare committee meeting presentation, meeting agenda, list of items needed / questions 
- Revise bypass application based on committee input 
- Submit bypass 
- Schedule qualifying exam 
- NSA quarterly newsletter  

### O. lurida 2017-2018 project (OA/Temp carryover)
- Write cover letter for journal submission 
- Revise MS based on 2nd round of co-author feedback 
- Submit! 

### O. lurida 2018 project (Temp/Food carryover)
- Calculate degree-days until larval release onset for all spawning tanks (if possible).
- Figure out how to do broodstock survival analysis, then do it
- Write Intro
- Finalize plots
- Send to co-authors

### Oly QuantSeq: 
- Start testing QuantSeq analysis pipeline with Oly genome, Salmon (removing the multiple read/transcript auto-correct), Trinityâ€™s isogroup designation file.
- Schedule benchwork, order supplies  

### Oly epigenetics project 
- Wrap my head around action plan, steps for analysis
